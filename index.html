    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. </li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration-line: line-through; font-weight: bold;">CSS is not necessary</span> 
            <span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> 
            It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:-</h3>
    <ul style="letter-spacing:4px">
        <li>Inline - using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>
        <li>Internal - using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - usind a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,
            <span id="pt3">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>
            , because this is easier to demonstrate, and easire for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements,
        ID on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. 
        ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by JavaScript.<br><br>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. 
        Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.<br><br>
        There is a wide range of selecors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.
        Both are used to target elements to which a style is to be applied.
